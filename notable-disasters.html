    <h2 class="text-center">Some of the worst theme park failures of all time</h2>

    <h3 class="m-3">Action Park</h3>
    <p class="m-3">Frequently referred to as "Class Action Park" or Accident Park, Action Park in Vernon Townshhip, NJ had an extremely poor safety record, resulting in at least 6 deaths due to ride mishaps. It is widely considered the worst theme park of all time, and has now become ome of the most infamous locations on the planet.</p>

    <p class="m-3">A few particularly notable attractions stand out.</p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Alpine Slide:</strong> A plastic sled in a concrete tobaggan.
            Two speeds: "Snail in peanut butter" and "Death awaits."</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Canonball Falls: </strong>Park guests could ride down one of two dark, covered slides before landing in pool that was up to 30 degrees colder than other park pools. </li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>The Diving Cliffs:</strong> Artificially constructed to appear as natural cliffs in a tropical environment. Many people weren't aware of the jumpers in the pool below, resulting in numerous injuries.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Surf Hill: </strong>Multi-lane hump slide common to many water parks today... except for the seventh hill, which had an extra hill. It was commonly referred to as the "back-breaker."</li>
        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Cannonball Loop: </strong>Undoubtedly the worst attraction ever created - an enclosed water slide with a full vertical loop in the middle. Seriously. This was real.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="m-3">Six Flags New Orleans</h3>
    <p class="m-3">The park opened in 2000 under the name "Jazzland," and was acquired by Six Flags in 2003 and renamed Six Flags New Orleans. In 2005, hurricane Katrina hits and floods the entire park. As a result, it has since been abandoned. The gates remain locked. Several attempts were made to reopen the park under various owners, but none were successful. Several Blockbuster movies have taken advantage of the creepy atmosphere.</p>
